#Now

Currently based in Edinburgh working as a web developer for an online hospitality training company, using Python for most of the day-to-day stuff. I also work on a couple of side projects using my  a mix of Python, data analysis and web-scraping (for now!). 

#Background

Before all of that I received a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Hertfordshire, and then on to the University of Surrey to study a masters degree in physics, following the 'radiation detection and instrumentation' pathway. During my bachelor's degree I had the opportunity to spend 1 year at CERN as a technical student, and returned during my masters degree to write my thesis on the applications for mixed-field radiation testing. I went on to start a Phd in nuclear physics, but decided around half-way through to pursue something different..
